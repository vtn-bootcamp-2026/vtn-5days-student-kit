## Inter-Skill Communication Protocol

```
How skills pass data to each other:

Method 1 — File handoff (recommended):
  Skill A writes: 02-processing/[step-name]/output.md
  Skill B reads:  02-processing/[step-name]/output.md
  
Method 2 — Context injection:
  Orchestrator reads Skill A output
  Includes relevant section in Skill B prompt

Method 3 — Structured JSON:
  For machine-readable data exchange:
  02-processing/[step-name]/output.json
```

## Skill Reuse Check

Before building a new skill, verify existing skills can't cover it:

| Function needed | Check existing skill |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Web research | `deep-research` |
| Summarization/synthesis | `vibe-overview` |
| Problem solving | `vibe-gps` |
| Document writing | `vibe-humanizer` |
| User feedback | `vibe-user-review` |

Only build new skill if existing coverage < 70% of needed function.
